## 1. How We Collect Your Data

Denther obtains Personal Data about you from various sources to provide our Services and to manage our Sites. “You” may be a **visitor** to one of our websites, or a **user** of one or more of our Services (“User”).

If you visit or use our Sites, we may collect your Personal Data. For example, we collect Personal Data that you submit to us via online forms and surveys, and when you contact us by email.  

If you are a User, we generally categorize the personal information we collect about you in three categories:

1. Personal data
2. Health data
3. Usage data

## 2. Personal Data We Collect

### 2.1. Personal Data

Personal Data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. The Personal Data that you provide directly to us through our Sites and Services will be apparent from the context in which you provide the data.  

In particular:  
When you register for a Denther account, we collect either your Reddit username, or full name and email address from Google.  
When you fill-in our online form to contact our sales team, we collect your full name, email, country, and anything else you tell us about your needs and timeline.
When you use the “Remember Me” feature of Payment Checkout, our Payment Processor collects your email address, payment card number, CVC code and expiration date.
When you respond to Denther emails or surveys, we collect your email address, name and any other information you choose to include in the body of your email or responses. 
If you contact us by phone, we will collect the phone number you use to call Denther. If you contact us by phone as a Denther User, we may collect additional information in order to verify your identity.  
If you are a Denther User, you will provide your contact details, such as name, postal address, telephone number, and email address. As part of your relationship with us, we may also receive financial and personal information about you, such as your date of birth and government identifiers associated with you and your organization (such as your social security number, tax number, or Employer Identification Number).  

You may also choose to submit information to us via other methods, including:

- (i) in response to marketing or other communications,
- (ii) through social media or online forums,
- (iii) through participation in an offer, program or promotion,
- (iv) in connection with an actual or potential business relationship with us, or
- (v) by giving us your business card or contact details at trade shows or other events.

### 2.2. Health Data

The main type of information we hold about you is health and medical information: information about your health, symptoms, treatments, consultations and sessions, opinions, diagnoses, recommendations, health care reviews, medications, procedures, purchases of health services and related financial information.  

This includes details of your consultations and interactions with our dental providers. Your interactions with our digital services may be shared with our dental providers in order to provide you with a better experience and for the purposes of providing you health care.

We get some of this information directly from you, when you register with us and when you use our Services. If you share your Add records form with a dental provider, we will receive your health data from them. If you have given consent for us to do so, we will send your case records to your dental provider. Any such correspondence we receive from you is uploaded electronically to your Denther dental record or personal profile.

We retain records of our consultations and interactions with you. This is so that we can ensure high quality care is provided to you, and, with your consent, to allow us to learn from them to improve our services. To monitor our service quality, we may retain records of when you contact our support teams. Recordings are held securely in accordance with our retention policy. You can access recordings or transcripts of your consultations or interactions with us (depending on the format) for a limited time from us. Please refer to the ‘Retention Periods’ section of this policy.

We may also hold information about you and your health from other apps, devices and services where you have given your consent to that data being shared with us.

Our [HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices](https://documentation.denther.com/docs/legal/privacy/privacy-notice) describes our privacy practices for your HIPAA Protected Health Information. It does not apply to the Personal Data or Usage Data that we collect from you through the Services. We include a link to our [HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices](https://documentation.denther.com/docs/legal/privacy/privacy-notice) on webpages where we collect information from you is treated as “Medical Information” or “HIPAA Protected Health Information”.

## 3. How We Use Personal Data

The purposes for which we use your personal data and the legal grounds on which we do so are as follows:

### 3.1. Providing you a service

We obtain and use your personal details and financial details in order to establish and deliver our contract with you and (if applicable) charge you correctly.

We obtain and use your medical information because this is necessary for medical purposes, including medical diagnosis and the provision of healthcare or treatment. This includes the information collected through our consultations with you (such as notes and recordings), our digital services, and medical history from your previous dentist (in the same way that any dental practice would receive your medical history if they become your dentist). It may also include sharing information with other healthcare professionals, chosen by you, as necessary for the provision of care to you.

Our [HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices](https://documentation.denther.com/docs/legal/privacy/privacy-notice) describes our privacy practices for your HIPAA Protected Health Information.

In the course of daily operations, access to private, sensitive and confidential information is restricted to authorized employees who have a legitimate business purpose and reason for accessing it. For example, when you call us, or email us, our designated employees will access your information to assist you in providing services to you. It is important to note that only dental professionals or others on a need-to-know basis will have access to your Health Information.

As a condition of their employment, all employees of Denther are required to abide by the privacy standards we have established. They are also required to work within the principles of ethical behaviour as set out in our internal employee rules and must follow all applicable laws and regulations. Employees are well informed about the importance of privacy and they are required to sign either a code of conduct or a confidentiality agreement that prohibits the disclosure of any Personal Information to unauthorized individuals or parties.

Unauthorized access to and/or disclosure of client information by an employee of Denther is strictly prohibited. All employees are expected to maintain the confidentiality of Personal Information at all times and failing to do so will result in appropriate disciplinary measures, which may include dismissal.

### 3.2. Making healthcare accessible

Where you have provided your explicit consent, we will use your medical information (always having removed personal identifiers) to improve our healthcare products and services, so that we can deliver better healthcare to you and other Denther users. This medical information (with your personal identifiers removed in the way described above) may include your medical record (both records received and created by us), transcripts and recordings of your consultations, and your interactions with our services. This does not involve making any decisions which would have a significant effect on you – it is only about improving our products, services and software so that we can deliver a better experience to you and other Denther users, and help achieve our aim of making healthcare affordable and accessible to everyone. Strict confidentiality and data security provisions apply at all times. This consent relates to information that can identify you.

We may obtain and use data about your precise location where you give your consent (through providing us access to your location through your App or browser settings or your address), for example, to help direct you to the nearest dentist. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.

### 3.3. Keeping you up to date

We use your email address, phone number and/or details to contact you or present you with occasional updates and marketing messages where you have not opted out, based on our legitimate interest in marketing our services to you and subject to your right to opt out at any time.

As part of providing you with high quality preventative and occupational health care services, we may contact you by SMS, email and/or other means to offer you helpful information or invite you to make appointments, for example for free healthcare screening programmes.

### 3.4. Other uses

Based on our legitimate interest in managing and planning our business, we may analyse data about your use of our products and services to troubleshoot bugs within the App or our website, forecast demand of service and to understand other trends in use, including which features users use the most and find most helpful, and what features users require from us. This does not involve making any decisions about you that would have a significant legal effect on you – it is only about improving our App so that we can deliver better services to you. Strict confidentiality and data security provisions will apply at all times.  

Where necessary, we may need to share personal and financial details for the purposes of fraud prevention and detection.  

We also store your medical information, such as uploaded dental images, examination notes, findings and comments given by our dentists, as well as your interactions with our digital services, for safety, regulatory, and compliance purposes. For example, we may need to review your information and, where necessary, make disclosures in compliance with reasonable requests by regulatory bodies, or as otherwise required by law or regulation.  

Where necessary for safety, regulatory and/or compliance purposes, we may audit consultations and your other interactions with our services. Strict confidentiality and data security provisions will apply at all times to any such audit and access.

## 4. How We Disclose Personal Data

We consider all information we collect from you to be confidential. We do not sell, rent or lease your Personal Information to third parties. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties, as follows:

- **Dental providers.** We may disclose your health information to dental providers in order to provide you with dental services you requested.

The below is a summary of our retention policy, but we may retain records that do not identify you for legitimate business purposes such as managing or planning our business, or records for other periods as required by law or regulation.
We retain your Personal Data as long as we are providing the Services to you. We retain Personal Data after we cease providing Services directly or indirectly to you, even if you close your Denther account or complete a transaction with a Denther User, to the extent necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, and for the purpose of fraud monitoring, detection and prevention. We also retain Personal Data to comply with our tax, accounting, and financial reporting obligations, where we are required to retain the data by our contractual commitments to our financial partners, and where data retention is mandated by the payment methods that we support. Where we retain data, we do so in accordance with any limitation periods and records retention obligations that are imposed by applicable law.

Dental Records are retained for 10 years after death or after the patient has permanently left the country unless the patient remains in the European Union. In the case of a child, if the illness or death could have potential relevance to adult conditions or have genetic implications for the family of the deceased, the advice of clinicians should be sought as to whether to retain the records for a longer period.
