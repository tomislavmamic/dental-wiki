## 3. Responsibilities

### a. Denther’s Responsibilities

To the extent Denther is acting as a Business Associate, Denther agrees to the following:

#### (i) Limitations on Use and Disclosure

Denther shall not Use and/or Disclose the Protected Health Information other than as permitted or required by the Agreement and/or this BAA or as otherwise Required by Law.  

Denther shall not disclose, capture, maintain, scan, index, transmit, share or Use Protected Health Information for any activity not authorized under the Agreement and/or this BAA.  
Denther shall not use Protected Health Information for any advertising, Marketing or other commercial purpose of Denther or any third party.  

Denther shall not violate the HIPAA prohibition on the sale of Protected Health Information.  
Denther shall make reasonable efforts to Use, Disclose, and/or request the minimum necessary Protected Health Information to accomplish the intended purpose of such Use, Disclosure, or request.  

Denther may use PHI to create de-identified information in a manner consistent with the standards stated in HIPAA, and may use or disclose such de-identified PHI for any purpose in accordance with HIPAA.  

#### (ii) Safeguards

Denther shall: (1) use reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent inappropriate Use and Disclosure of Protected Health Information other than as provided for in this BAA; and (2) comply with the applicable requirements of 45 CFR Part 164 Subpart C of the Security Rule.  

#### (iii) Reporting

Denther shall report to Customer:

1. any Use and/or Disclosure of Protected Health Information that is not permitted or required by this BAA of which Denther becomes aware; 
1. any Security Incident of which it becomes aware, provided that notice is hereby deemed given for Unsuccessful Security Incidents and no further notice of such Unsuccessful Security Incidents shall be given; and/or 
1. any Breach of Customer’s Unsecured Protected Health Information that Denther may discover (in accordance with 45 CFR § 164.410 of the Breach Notification Rule). Notification of a Breach will be made without unreasonable delay, but in no event more than five (5) business days after Denther’s determination of a Breach. Taking into account the level of risk reasonably likely to be presented by the Use, Disclosure, Security Incident, or Breach, the timing of other reporting will be made consistent with Denther’s and Customer’s legal obligations.  
  
For purposes of this Section, “Unsuccessful Security Incidents” mean, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on Denther’s firewall, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, denial of service attacks, and any combination of the above, as long as no such incident results in unauthorized access, acquisition, Use, or Disclosure of Protected Health Information.  Notification(s) under this Section, if any, will be delivered to contacts identified by Customer pursuant to Section 3b(ii) (Contact Information for Notices) of this BAA by any means Denther selects, including through e-mail.  Denther’s obligation to report under this Section is not and will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Denther of any fault or liability with respect to any Use, Disclosure, Security Incident, or Breach.  

To the extent practicable, Denther will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any further harmful effects of a Security Breach caused by Denther.  

#### (iv) Subcontractors

In accordance with 45 CFR §§ 164.502(e)(1)(ii) and 164.308(b)(2) of HIPAA, Denther shall require its Subcontractors who create, receive, maintain, or transmit Protected Health Information on behalf of Denther to agree in writing to:

#### (ii) Contact Information for Notices

Customer hereby agrees that any reports, notification, or other notice by Denther pursuant to this BAA may be made electronically. Customer shall provide contact information in Services and to [hipaa@denther.com](mailto:hipaa@denther.com) for other Services (or such other location or method of updating contact information as Denther may specify from time to time for each Service) and shall ensure that Customer’s contact information remains up to date during the term of this BAA.  Contact information for Services must include the security contact information which must include name of individual(s) to be contacted, title of individuals(s) to be contacted, e-mail address of individual(s) to be contacted, name of Customer organization, and, if available, Customer’s contract number, subscriber identification number.  Failure to submit and maintain as current the aforementioned contact information may delay Denther’s ability to provide Breach notification under this BAA.

#### (ii) Safeguards and Appropriate Use of Protected Health Information

Customer is responsible for implementing appropriate privacy and security safeguards to protect its Protected Health Information in compliance with HIPAA.  Without limitation, it is Customer’s obligation to:

2. Implement privacy and security safeguards in the systems, applications, and software Customer controls, configures, and uploads into the Services or uses in connection with the Services.  

#### (iv) Limitations on Use and Disclosure

1. Customer will notify Denther of any changes in, or revocation of, the permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes may affect Denther's use or disclosure of PHI. 
1. Customer will not agree to any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI under 45 CFR § 164.522 that restricts Denther's use or disclosure of PHI under the Agreement unless such restriction is required by law.

## 4. Applicability of BAA

This BAA is applicable to Services. Denther may, from time to time, (a) include additional services on the “Services” section of the Agreement, and (b) update the definition of Services in this BAA accordingly, and such updated definitions will apply to Customer without additional action by Customer.  It is Customer’s obligation to not store or process in an online service, or provide to Denther for performance of a professional service, protected health information (as that term is defined in 45 CFR § 160.103 of HIPAA) until this BAA is effective as to the applicable service.
