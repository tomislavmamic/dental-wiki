## 1. Denther Services

Denther offers services (“Denther Services”), such as helping you to:

find and learn about nearby dental providers, 
book appointments with the dental providers of your choice (each, “Your Dental Provider”),
share your health data with Your Dental Providers,
collect your health data from Your Dental Providers, and
collect and analyze dental findings and recommendations from Denther-appointed dental providers.

As part of providing the Denther Services, Denther may collect, use, share, and exchange your dental records and other health-related information with Your Dental Providers. Under a federal law called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), health and health-related information may be considered “protected health information” or “PHI” if such information is received from or on behalf of Your Healthcare Providers.

## 2. Safeguards for PHI

HIPAA protects the privacy and security of your PHI by limiting the uses and disclosures of PHI by most healthcare providers and by health plans (called “Covered Entities”) as well as companies, like Denther, that provide certain types of assistance to Covered Entities (called “Business Associates”). Under certain circumstances described in HIPAA, an individual needs to sign an Authorization form before a Covered Entity, like Your Healthcare Provider(s), can disclose protected health information to a third party.

## 3. Non-Protected Health Information

As a condition of creating your Denther account, you are required to read and agree to Denther’s [Privacy Policy](). Denther’s Privacy Policy explains how Denther processes and shares information received from you that is not covered by HIPAA (“Non-PHI”).

## 4. Your PHI Authorization

The purpose of this Denther Authorization (“Authorization”) is to request your written permission to allow Denther to use and disclose your PHI in the same way as we use and disclose your Non-PHI. If Denther is a Business Associate of Your Healthcare Providers, Denther needs your Authorization to be able to use and disclose your PHI in the same way it can currently use and disclose your Non-PHI when Denther is not working on behalf of Your Healthcare Providers, but is instead working on its own behalf. Therefore, when Denther relies on this Authorization, and uses and discloses PHI as described in this Authorization, it is not working as a Business Associate and the HIPAA requirements that apply to Business Associates will not apply to such uses and disclosures.

If you e-sign this Authorization, you give your permission to Denther to retain your PHI and to use and/or disclose your PHI in the same way that you have agreed that your Non-PHI can be used and disclosed.

Specifically, you agree that Denther can use your PHI to:

- enable and customize your use of the Denther Services;
- provide you alerts or other Denther Services regarding future appointments;
- notify you regarding providers we think you may be interested in learning more about;
- share information with you regarding services, products or resources about which we think you may be interested in learning more;
- provide you with updates and information about the Denther Services;
- market to you about Denther and third party products and services;
- conduct analysis for Denther’s business purposes;
- support development of the Denther Services; and
- create de-identified information and then use and disclose this information in any way permitted by law, including to third parties in connection with their commercial and marketing efforts.

You also agree that Denther can disclose your PHI to:

- third parties assisting Denther with any of the uses described above;
- Your Healthcare Providers to enable them to refer you to, and make appointments with, other providers on your behalf, or to perform an analysis on potential health issues or treatments, provided that you choose to use the applicable Denther Service;
- a third party as part of a potential merger, sale or acquisition of Denther;
- our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to the operation or provision of our services, even when Denther is no longer working on behalf of Your Healthcare Providers;
- a provider of medical services, in the event of an emergency; and
- organizations that collect, aggregate and organize your information so they can make it more easily accessible to your providers.

## 5. Redisclosure

If Denther discloses your PHI, Denther will require that the person or entity receiving your PHI agrees to only use and disclose your PHI to carry out its specific business obligations to Denther or for the permitted purpose of the disclosure (as described above) Denther cannot, however, guarantee that any such person or entity to which Denther discloses your PHI or other information will not re-disclose it in ways that you or we did not intend or permit.

## 6. Expiration and Revocation of Authorization

Your Authorization remains in effect until you provide written notice of revocation to Denther.

YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND AND REVOKE THIS AUTHORIZATION AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY (OR NO) REASON.

If you wish to revoke this Authorization, you must notify Denther by submitting a revocation through your account settings page. Your decision not to execute this Authorization or to revoke it at any time will not affect your ability to use certain of the Denther Services. A Revocation of Authorization is effective after you submit it to Denther, but it does not have any effect on Denther’s prior actions taken in reliance on the Authorization before revoked.

Once Denther receives your Revocation of Authorization, Denther can only use and disclose your PHI as permitted in Denther’s agreements with Your Healthcare Provider(s). Your Revocation of Authorization does not affect Denther’s use of your Non-PHI.

We will make available to Your Healthcare Provider(s), current and past, your agreement to or revocation of this Authorization.
