To evaluate your oral health, we first need sufficient dental records. Depending on the case, we might need more or less information.  

:::caution Important
If you are a first time user, you will have to do the first exam.
:::

The first exam includes everything we need to know to make a diagnosis for most common cases.

:::note Six steps of the first exam

1. Current complaint
2. Dental history
3. Medical history
4. Dental photos
5. X-ray images
6. Clinical tests

:::

## Current complaint

When you register or create a new case, first you will have to fill in [Current Complaint Questionnaire](../medical/records/3-complaint.md).  

Here we want to know what bothers you at this moment. Tell us about any pain you are experiencing, or a lesion in your gums or other soft tissue. You can also specify some other important things.

## Dental history

As a part of your first exam, you have to provide some information about your [Dental history](../medical/records/5-dental-history.md).

## Medical history

As a part of your first exam, you have to provide some information about your [Medical history](../medical/records/6-medical-history.md).

## Photos

[Dental photographs](../medical/records/1-photography.md) are not the same thing as dental radiographs (also known as x-rays). Since we can't see you in person, we require lifelike photos of your mouth. In your first exam, we will do a full set of dental photos which we can use as many times as needed.

## X-rays

:::note Initial x-rays

* Panoramic xray (ortopantomogram)
* Right posterior teeth bitewing x-ray
* Left posterior teeth bitewing x-ray

:::

## Clinical tests

:::note Clinical tests

* Palpation
* Percussion
* Teeth sensibility test
* Sextant periodontal probing
* Tooth mobility index

:::



The collected data from the current complaint, dental and medical history are thoroughly analyzed in order to provide an insight into the oral as well as general health of the patient.   
Diagnostic tests, radiographic images and dental photography protocol consisting of a series of images of teeth and oral mucosa give an objective and detailed view of the condition of the tissues mentioned above.
