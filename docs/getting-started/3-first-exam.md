# First exam
  
The first step in evaluating a patient's oral health and making a diagnosis is the first exam of the patient.  
The first exam provides us with very important information that are crucial in making a diagnosis and it consists of several steps:
### Step 1 - Current complaint questionnaire

### Step 2 - Dental history questionnaire

### Step 3 - Medical history questionnaire

### Step 4 - Dental photography protocol

### Step 5 - Radiographic images: Right and left posterior and anterior bitewing images

### Step 6 - Diagnostic tests
 * Palpation
*  Percussion
* Teeth sensibility test
*  Sextant periodontal probing 
* Tooth mobility index

The collected data from the current complaint, dental and medical history are thoroughly analyzed in order to provide an insight into the oral as well as general health of the patient.   
Diagnostic tests, radiographic images and dental photography protocol consisting of a series of images of teeth and oral mucosa give an objective and detailed view of the condition of the tissues mentioned above.
