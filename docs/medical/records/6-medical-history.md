### Has there been any change in your general health within the past year?

Data on the patient's changed health status in the last year can be of great importance in making a dental diagnosis. Certain systemic diseases can be the cause of certain pathological changes in the oral mucosa and hard dental tissues.
If yes, what condition was/is being treated?

---

### Date of last physical exam.

This question involves entering the date of the last medical examination by the family physician or specialist. If the patient does not remember the exact date, he can enter the approximate date of the examination.

---

### Have you had a serious illness, operation or been hospitalised in the past 5 years?

Answer to this question  provides a better insight into the patient’s health status in the past. 
Serious illnesses that require surgery or treatment in a hospital setting are illnesses that can seriously affect a patient's general health, including oral health. In most cases,  serious chronic diseases include long-term use of various drugs and the use of treatments that can cause various side effects on oral tissues long after they are discontinued from regular use. 

If yes, what was the illness or problem?

---

### Are you taking or have you recently taken any prescription or over the counter medicine?

A wide range of prescription and over the counter drugs can cause various oral side effects:e.g. dry mouth, redness of the mucosa, altered taste, swelling of the lips or tongue.  etc.

### Are you taking, or have you taken, any of these diet drugs?

Diet medications: Pondimine (phenylfuramine), Redux (dexfenfluramine), Phen-fen (fenfluramine-phentermine combination) were used as appetite suppressants.

For this reason, prior to the dental treatment of these patients, antibiotic prophylaxis is required. 
These medications have oral side effects such as dysgeusia or metallic taste in the mouth, dry mouth, and prolonged paraesthesia, which may be important for the diagnosis of oral diseases.

### Are you taking or scheduled to begin either of these medications?

Alendronate (Fosamax) Risedronate (Actonel) are bisphosphonates, drugs used in treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease and in treatment and prevention of  bone metastases of various malignant  tumors.
 These drugs have a serious side effect: osteoinecrosis of the jaw, which is manifested by exposed bone in the oral cavity, inflammation and pain. Osteonecrosis most often occurs after tooth extraction, but it can also occur spontaneously.
 Information on the use of these drugs is very important in distinguishing this disease from other diseases with similar symptoms but a completely different cause: osteoradionecrosis and osteomyelitis.
