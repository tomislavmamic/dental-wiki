Minor pain , annoying and may have occasional stronger twinges. Like lightly pinching the fold of the skin between the thumb and the first finger of the opposite hand, using fingernails.  

Tolerable  
Very noticeable and distracting pain, however, you can get used to it and adapt- like an accidental cut or a blow to the nose causing a bloody nose or a doctor giving you an  injection.  

Distressing  
Strong , deep pain. You notice the pain all the time and cannot completely adapt. If you are deeply involved in activity it can be ignored for a period of time, but still distracting. Like a minor trauma such as stubbing your toe.  

Very distressing  
Strong, deep pain. You notice the pain all the time and you are preoccupied by managing it. It can be ignore for more than few minutes , but with an effort. You still can manage work or participate in some activities. Like a sprained ankle or back pain.  

Intense  
Pain that interferes with normal daily activities and partially dominate your senses . You have difficulties concentrating. Like a really bad non-migraine headache.  

Very intense  
Pain that dominates your senses completely and significantly limits your ability to perform simple daily activities or maintain social relationships. This pain interferes with sleep. Like a migraine.  

Utterly horrible  
Pain sto bad that you can no longer think clearly at all, and have often undergone severe personality change if the pain has been present for a long time. Physical activity is severely limited and conversing requires great effort.  

Excruciating/Unbearable  
Pain  so intense that you cannot tolerate it. Unable to converse, crying out and /or mourning uncontrollably.  

Unimaginable/unspeakable  
Pain so intense that you will briefly go unconscious. Bedridden and possibly delirious. Very few people will ever experience this level of pain.  

The perception of pain varies in different individuals. The scale often helps to quantify how much pain the patient is actually having. The severity of pain gives an impression of the acuteness of the symptoms felt by the patient, thus helping in making a proper diagnosis.
