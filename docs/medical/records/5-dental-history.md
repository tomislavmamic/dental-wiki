### Have you ever had a serious injury to your head or mouth?

Serious head and mouth injuries occur as a result of trauma to the head, face and mouth resulting in serious injuries such as fractures of the jaws and facial bones, avulsions and luxation injuries of the teeth, as well as injuries to the temporomandibular joint.
