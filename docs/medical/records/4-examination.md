### Discomfort Survey

---

#### Do you have any intraoral discomfort or difficulty?

The answer to this question provides information about the presence of difficulties that occurred during the intraoral examination, which are not the chief complaint for which the patient is seeking the dental examination.

*Single choice*:  

ðŸ”˜ Yes  
ðŸ”˜ No  
ðŸ”˜ Don't know  

If yes, please specify.  
`Short text`

#### Do you have any other extraoral (facial) discomfort or difficulty?

The answer to this question provides information about the presence of difficulties that occurred during the extraoral examination,  which are not the chief complaint for which the patient is seeking the dental examination.

*Single choice*:  

ðŸ”˜ Yes  
ðŸ”˜ No  
ðŸ”˜ Don't know  

If yes, please specify.

### Percussion Test

Percussion is a diagnostic test that is performed by tapping the instrument on the tooth surface.

This test is performed to evaluate inflammation of the periodontal ligament, which can be caused by an infection from dental pulp, periodontal pocket or trauma.

*Single choice* for each [Tooth](/docs/medical/areas#teeth):  

| Input | Meaning              |
|:-----:|:---------------------|
|   -   | No sensitivity       |
|   +   | Mild sensitivity     |
|  ++   | Moderate sensitivity |
|  +++  | Severe sensitivity   |

#### Horizontal percussion

Horizontal percussion is performed by tapping the instrument on the buccal or vestibular surface of the tooth.

#### Vertical percussion

Vertical percussion is performed vertically with the longitudinal axis of the tooth, tapping on the occlusal surface or incisal edge.

### Cold Test

Cold test is  tooth sensibillity test that is  performed by applying cold stimulus(cotton ball sprayed with cold spray or an ice cube) to the tooth surface.

This diagnostic test is  used to assess the health of the dental pulp by determining the sensory response of the pulpal nerve fibers. Based on the results of this test, the vitality of the pulp is indirectly concluded.

*Single choice* for each [Tooth](/docs/medical/areas#teeth):  

| Input | Meaning              |
|:-----:|:---------------------|
|   -   | No reaction          |
|   +   | Normal reaction      |
|  ++   | Extended reaction    |
|  +++  | Very strong reaction |

### Intraoral Palpation

 Intraoral palpation is a diagnostic test performed by gently pressing with the fingertips to determine if there is discomfort, pain or  tenderness of the examined tissues.
 
 
*Single choice* for each [Quadrant](/docs/medical/areas#quadrants):  

ðŸ”˜  Not checked  
ðŸ”˜  Not painful  
ðŸ”˜  Painful

#### Alveolar Ridge Palpation

Involves palpation of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar ridge.

#### Buccal/vestibular Sulcus Palpation

Involves palption of upper and lower buccal/vestibular sulci. 

---

### Extraoral Palpation

Extraoral palpation involves palpation of the head and neck tissues and regional lymph nodes.

*Single choice*  

ðŸ”˜ Painful  
ðŸ”˜ Not painful  
ðŸ”˜ Not checked  

If it's painful, please specify the area.

### Periodontal Examination

#### Plaque Index Score

*Single choice* for each *Index Surface* of each *Index Tooth*:  


| Input |       Meaning        |
|:-----:|:--------------------|
| 0 | No plaque |
| 1 | A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth, which cannot be seen with the naked eye, only by using the probe. |
| 2 | Moderate accumulation of deposits within the gingival pocket, on the gingival margin and/or adjacent tooth surface, which can be seen with the naked eye. |
| 3 | Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the tooth and gingival margin. |

*Index Surfaces:* `M, D, V or B, P or L`  
*Index Teeth:* `16, 12, 24, 36, 32, 44`

#### Sextant Periodontal Probing

*Single choice* for each [Sextant](/docs/medical/areas#sextants):  

| Input | Meaning                                                 |
|:-----:|:--------------------------------------------------------|
|   0   | Healthy                                                 |
|   1   | Bleeding after probing                                  |
|   2   | Calculus detected, black band visible completely        |
|   3   | Pocket 4-5 mm, black band on the gingival margin        |
|  3F   | 3 + Furcation involvement                               |
|   4   | Pocket 6mm or more, black band completely inside pocket |
|  4F   | 4 + Furcation involvement                               |
|   X   | Excluded sextant (less than two teeth present)          |

Based on the highest result from probing *Index Surfaces* `M, D, V or B, P or L` of each [Tooth](/docs/medical/areas#teeth) in [Sextant](/docs/medical/areas#sextants).
