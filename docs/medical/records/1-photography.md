This image reflects the health condition or any present pathological change of the dorsum of the tongue. (Liu et al. 2019, fig. 135)
* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position). 
* Ask the patient to stick out his tongue. 
* Stand in front of him and shoot. The center is the tongue; the horizontal line should be perpendicular to the long axis of the tongue .

This image should contain tongue tissue and part of the perioral tissue. If patient, due to some pathological reasons cannot stick
his tongue out of mouth, operator may use retractor and mirror to shoot: 

* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position). 
* Ask the patient to put put the tip of the tongue against lingual side of lower anterior teeth
* Leave suction on the floor of the mouth before shooting in order to maintain good quality of image by reducing the amount of saliva in the oral cavity, especially on the mouth floor. 
* Pull the lip tissue 45° downward using modified retractors or small retractors. 
* Use the big mirror for shooting . Position the big mirror as close as the upper teeth. 
* The operator stands in front of the patient and takes the image from the mirror.

#### Ventrum of Tongue Mucosa Image

This image reflects the health condition or any present pathological change of the ventral mucosa of the tongue. (Liu et al. 2019, fig. 138)

* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position). 
* Use big retractors to pull the lip tissue.
* Ask the patient to put his tip of the tongue against palatal mucosa. 
* The operator stands in front of the patient and shoots. The lingual frenulum is centric, the horizontal line is perpendicular with the lingual frenulum. 

#### Lateral Side Image of Tongue Mucosa(left and right)

This image reflects the health condition or any present pathological change of the lateral sides of the tongue. ( Liu et al. 2019, fig. 139; fig. 140)

* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position) . 
* Use big retractors to pull the lip tissue 
* Ask the patient to put his tip of the tongue against the opposite commissural. 
* The operator stands in front of the patient and shoots. 
* This image should contain all tongue body tissue. Tongue body is centric; the horizontal line is the boundary of the dorsum and ventral side of the tongue. 

#### Mucosa Image of Mouth Floor

This image reflects the health condition or any present pathological change of the mucosa of the mouth floor. This image can be used for recording and evaluating salivary secretion. (Liu et al. 2019, fig.141)



* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position) .
* Use the finger retractors to pull the lip tissue 45° downward.
* Use the big mirror for the shooting. Ask the patient to roll back his tongue and cover the tongue with the mirror
* Try to position the big mirror as close as the upper teeth. 
* Leave suction on the floor of the mouth before shooting in order to maintain good quality of image by removing large amounts of saliva from the mouth floor. 
* The operator stands in the front and takes the image from the mirror. This image may contain all the tissue of the floor of the mouth.

#### Buccal Gingival Sulcusmucosa Image( upper right and left, lower right and left)

This image represents the health condition or any present pathological change on the tissue of the buccal gingival sulcus. ( Liu et al. fig. 143; fig. 144)

* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position) .
* Use the big retractors to pull the lip tissue. 
* Pull strongly in the shooting side while holding the tissue using the big retractor in the opposite side and shoot directly the mucosa around the buccal gingival sulcus area. This image should contain all tissue of buccal gingival sulcus, of which horizontal line is the migration line.

#### Hard palate mucosa image

This image reflects the health condition or any present pathological change on the mucosa of the hard palate. (Liu et al. 2019, fig. 145)


* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position) .
* Use small retractors to pull lips 45° upward.
* Use a big mirror for shooting. Set a big mirror as close as lower teeth and shoot indirectly.
* This image includes all tissue of palatal mucosa, of which horizontal line is perpendicular to the palatal midline.

#### Soft palate mucosa image (using mirror)
This image reflects the health condition or any present pathological change of the soft palatal mucosa. 
The method is the same as the one mentioned for a hard palatal mucosa image. (Liu et al. 2019, fig. 146)

* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position) .
* Use small retractors to pull lips 45° upward.
* Use a big mirror for shooting. Set a big mirror as close as lower teeth and shoot indirectly.The operator only has to position the mirror deeper then can get the image of soft palatal mucosa.
* The method described above, might make patient feel uncomfortable

#### Soft palate mucosa image (taking directly)
This image reflects the health condition or any present pathological change of the soft palatal mucosa. (Liu et al. 2019, fig.147)

* Ask the patient to sit on a dental chair (45° to the ground -chair position) .
*  Use the big retractors to pull out the lips.
*  Ask the patient to open wide
*  Take the mucosa image of the soft palate directly. 
* This image will also contain part of the tongue image.
